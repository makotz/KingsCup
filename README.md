# Facebook Messenger King's Cup Bot
This is a Facebook Messenger App to play the popular drinking game, King's Cup without a deck of cards.
Rather than building the whole bot on this Rails App, I am handling the logic and sending JSON files to Chatfuel's UX friendly bot builder.

When the bot is live, I will link it here.
